# 1. Write a method which takes a list of numbers. Print the even numbers and odd numbers contained in the list.
# Input: input_list = [12,45,234,42,53,134,577,214,4,256,85,768]
# Output: Even numbers are 12,234,42,134,214,4,256,768
# 	      Odd numbers are 45,53,577,85

assign1_input = [12, 34, 45, 83, 342, 21, 435, 234, 12, 532, 12, 45]


# 2.Given a list in Python and a number x, count the number of occurrences of x in the given list.
# Example:
# Input : lst = [15, 6, 7, 10, 12, 20, 10, 28, 10]
#      	  x = 10
# Output : 3

assign2_input_1 = [12, 45, 56, 23, 45, 56, 45, 23]
assign2_input_2 = 45

# 3.Inverted Pyramid pattern with numbers
# Example:
# Input : 5
# Output:
# 1 1 1 1 1
# 2 2 2 2
# 3 3 3
# 4 4
# 5
assign3_input = 6
